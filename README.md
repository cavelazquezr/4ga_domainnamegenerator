# Domain Name Generator for 4Geeks Academy

Here you can find the app.js with the Domain Name Generator code with the following lists:

```
  var pronoun = ["the", "our"];
  var adj = ["great", "big"];
  var noun = ["jogger", "racoon", "memes", "coronet"];
  var extension = ["com", "net", "es"];
```

And domain hacks were applied. For example: instead of lastOfUs.com you can use the .us domain like this: lastOf.us
